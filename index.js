/*
*  Write a method to determine whether or not a given unsorted array contains a dominant member.
*
* A dominant member of an array is one that occuppies the majority of the array.  For example:
*
* In [2, 3, 3, 7, 4, 3, 3], '3' is the dominant member.
* 
* [2, 3, 3, 7, 4, 3] on the other hand, has no dominant member as '3' only occuppies 50% of the array.
*
* Try to solve this in the lowest big O space and time complexities possible.
